1. Annotations
Annotations also known as metadata, provide a formalized way to add information to your source code so that you can easliy use that data at some later point.
Annotations allow you to store extra information about your program in a format that is tested and verified by the compiler.
Most of the time, you will be defining your own annotations and writing your own processors to deal with them

annotation processers:
Without tools to read them, annotations are hardly more useful than comments. An important part of the process of using annotations is to create and use annotation processors.
